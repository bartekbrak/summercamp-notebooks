    "Hi everybody. We're glad to have you here! :) In short, this programmme is to teach you as much as possible about programming in the short timespan of three months that you decided to stay with us. But even more so, to teach you how to work in a real life, real work environment while collaborating with tens of people. Programming is comparatively easy, being a part of a large organisation, participating in a team, negotiating compromises, forming reputation, fitting in the company culture, expanding and giving back to this culture... that's something we can't teach you directly. But we can provide that environment, give you guidance and helping hand when you get stressed or confused. Observe, ask questions, communicate and don't be afraid to make mistakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The programme consists of one week of structured learning and then you join a team and dive into real work. It is not decided yet which team you'll end up with. In the next weeks, you'll also receive a half a day training at the end of each week on the subjects that we yet have to decide, we'll see what's needed when you start working with us. "
