    "\n",
    "In Python the use of threads is limited because of Python's Global Interpreter Lock. The way to deal with heavier tasks is to spread them between our CPU cores using multiple processes (for example using the multiprocessing module). This should work as long as the application we are developing is using one machine. And this is not the case in bigger production systems such as the ones that we have in company.\n",
    "\n",
    "To distribute work between multiple machines we need a communicating mechanism to spread the work among them. Our applications achieve parallelism with the help of RabbitMQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "RabbitMQ is a messaging framework that helps to distribute work across many machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "* supports multiple messaging protocols (we're interested in AMQP)\n",

    "\n",
    "A buffer that stores sent messages. There is no limitation to how many messages a single queue can hold. There is also no limitation as to how many producers can send a message to a queue, nor how many consumers can try to access it. When a message hits the existing queue, it waits there until consumed by a consumer accessing that particular queue. When a message hits a non-existent queue, it gets discarded.\n",
