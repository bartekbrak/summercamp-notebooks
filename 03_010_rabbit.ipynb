    "In Python the use of threads is limited because of Python's Global Interpreter Lock. The way to deal with heavier tasks is to spread them between our CPU cores using multiple processes (for example using the multiprocessing module). This should work as long as the application we are developing is using one machine. And this is not the case in bigger production systems such as the ones that we have in company.\n",
    "\n",
    "To distribute work between multiple machines we need a communicating mechanism to spread the work among them. Our applications achieve parallelism with the help of RabbitMQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "RabbitMQ is a messaging framework that helps to distribute work across many machines.\n",

    "RabbitMQ implements a flexible messaging protocol - AMQP (Advanced Message Queueing Protocol). \n",
    "Which is a binary protocol that provides flow controlled, message-oriented communication with message-delivery guarantees such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* at-most-once (each message is delivered once or never)\n",
    "* at-least-once (where each message is certain to be delivered, but may be delivered multiple times)\n",
    "* exactly-once (where the message will always certainly arrive and do so only once)\n",
    "\n",
    "It supports authentication and encryption (TLS/SASL).\n",
