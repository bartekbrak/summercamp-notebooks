    "In Python the use of threads is limited because of Python's Global Interpreter Lock. The way to deal with heavier tasks is to spread them between our CPU cores using multiple processes (for example using the multiprocessing module). This should work as long as the application we are developing is using one machine. And this is not the case in bigger production systems such as the ones that we have in company.\n",
