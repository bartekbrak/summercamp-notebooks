    "- [Python C API](http://docs.python.org/2/c-api/): Python is implemented in C, and you can actually write C code which will compile to a Python module!  This is extremely low-level, and I would only recommend it if you enjoy pain (see Dan Foreman-Mackie's [blog post](http://dan.iel.fm/posts/python-c-extensions/) for a concise-as-possible introduction)\n",
    "- [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/): the Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator, can generate wrappers from a variety of low-level languages to a variety of high-level languages.  It's used heavily by LSST and other projects.\n",
    "- [Weave](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/weave.html): included in SciPy, weave is a method of putting C snippets within a Python program.  It's largely been superseded by Cython in practice.\n",
    "- [PyPy](http://pypy.org/): a JIT compiler for Python written in Python.  PyPy doesn't support the C backend which most scientific tools rely on, so it's not extremely useful for scientific computing.\n",
