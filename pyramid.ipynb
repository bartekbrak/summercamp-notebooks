Many frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks and session management, and they often promote code reuse.\n",

    "The setup.py file is a setuptools setup file. It is meant to be run directly from the command line to perform a variety of functions, such as testing, packaging, and distributing your application.\n",

    "* python setup.py test -q\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at what pcreate generated in our working directory we can see that there are two directories:\n",
    "- static (to keep static files like images, css, js)\n",
    "- templates (to keep result pages rendered at the end of the request, e.g. html files)\n",
    "and two files (except __init__.py):\n",
    "- tests.py (basic tests template)\n",
    "- views.py (to build the logic that will be invoked on each request)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are purely conventions established by the scaffold: Pyramid doesn't insist that you name things in any particular way. However, it's generally a good idea to follow Pyramid standards for naming, so that other Pyramid developers can get up to speed quickly on your code when you need help."
